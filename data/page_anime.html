and world building which is dissapoiting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeason 3 started of with a typical generic school trip. Few attempts of comedy here and there that simply didn&#039;t land. Other than that some todoroki development and deku vs muscular build up were only things worth seeing first 3 episodes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharacters training was much longer than it should have been. Wasted some time imo. Deku vs muscular fight was okay. The animation was great but again it was so generic and it lacked both creativity and choreography. No tactics used at\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review290363">\n        all. It was just a flashy fight with 2 dudes punching each other with fists. I know, i know you are gonna say &quot;BuT MHa fIgHTs aRe ABouT StorY&quot; so is almost every fight in anime, that doesn&#039;t mean it should be mindless. On the plus side deku got some development. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAm i the only one that noticed how repetitive mha is? <br />\r\nSeason 1 is basically characters training, villains invading<br />\r\nseason 2 is trounament arc, villains invading and finally season 3 is characters training and villains invading. There is nothing new. There is no bigger, deeper plot to get invested in to.<br />\r\nLike always bunch of dumb villains that lack motivation appeared and i simply didn&#039;t care for them. There was that tsundare girl, that discount dead pool guy, mindless musuclar who is just killing for the sake of killing, that discount stain guy that was like a lizard or something, dude with big lips and uhhh what was his name again? That dude that&#039;s obviously todorokis brother or something. It&#039;s so predictable. On the plus side one thing that mha does good is the character desgins. Despite them looking goofy at times. At least they are memorable even tho the characters themselves aren&#039;t.<br />\r\nLong story short students fight some villains and bakugo gets captured even tho bakugo clearly could have prevented it but he didn&#039;t because... he is a angry brat that wants to be acnkowladged.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNext up is AFO vs All might fight... Again some good animation even tho there were some errors. We still don&#039;t know anything about AFO&#039;s motivation like with almost every vilalin in this show. He was supposed to be badass and his OST was supposed to be scary but it just wasn&#039;t. Not to mention his generic quirk... All might vs AFO was the peak of the season tho. It told the great story and it was good for all mights character. But we all knew all might was gonna win and he wins the most generic way possible. With final punch... The fight was dull from the actaul fighting perspective.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis show is just too safe. There is no suspenese, we just know good guys are gonna win. Even when bakugo was kidnapped he got retrieaved at the end. Everyone was just injured and they recovered. Even tho all might is my favorite character, his death would have made this show so much better. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecond arc was sooooooooo boring even tho it was filled with action. There was literally almost nothing big happening. There was a whole episode dedicated to rooms lmao. And again we get to the generic tournament arc with too many boring side cahracters that i don&#039;t care for. Mha is introducing too many, too fast. Side characters are very forgetable and the development is unievene. Even tho the cast is better than the terrible plot of this show it&#039;s still highly overrated. Too many bland characters with generic motivations and view points. Bakugo vs Deku was actaully good. I like bakugo more now even tho i still think his peronality is forced. Like why do you scream so much? I get that people had high expectations for you since birth but why so much? Tone it down ffs lmao. He is literally yelling at everyone around himself. It makes his personality unbelievable. The fight itself had the best choreography out of the 3. The animation was great too. &quot;The big 3&quot; was pretty overhyped. In temrs of character designs they are basically naruto, sasuke and sakura. Mirio is only one with potential out of the 3.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe art style this season is basic like always. All in all mha is enjoyable show with terrible plot. This season has very little story progression. The show itself doesn&#039;t stand out in any way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nP.S people are giving mha too much credit for executing the generic tropes well. It doesn&#039;t do it THAT well. It&#039;s a overstatement.\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_290363" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-290363">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Fanime%2F36456%2FBoku_no_Hero_Academia_3rd_Season" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle290363"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="290363">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=290363" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=290363" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right; text-align: right;">\n      <div title="5:17 PM">Mar 13, 2019</div>\n      <div class="lightLink spaceit">\n                  25 of 25 episodes seen\n              </div>\n      <div>\n        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$(\'#score303471\').toggle()">Overall Rating</a>:\n        1\n      </div>\n    </div><div style="float: left;">\n      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">\n        <tr>\n                                              <td valign="top" width="60">\n              <div class="picSurround">\n                <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/EnigmaOlivia">\n                  <img src="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/userimages/7432948.jpg?t=1587353400" data-src="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/userimages/7432948.jpg?t=1587353400" border="0" class=" lazyloaded" width="48">\n                </a>\n              </div>\n            </td>\n                    <td valign="top">\n                          <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/EnigmaOlivia">EnigmaOlivia</a>\n              <small>(<a href="/profile/EnigmaOlivia/reviews">All reviews</a>)</small><br>\n                        <div class="lightLink spaceit">\n              <strong>\n                <span id="rhelp303471">130</span>\n              </strong>\n              people found this review helpful\n            </div>\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class="spaceit textReadability word-break pt8 mt8" style="clear: both; border-top: 1px solid #ebebeb;">\n        <div style="float: left; display: none; margin: 0 10px 10px 0" id="score303471">\n      <table border="0" width="105" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="borderClass" style="border-width: 1px;">\n        <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass bgColor1"><strong>Overall</strong></td>\n          <td class="borderClass bgColor1"><strong>1</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass" align="left">Story</td>\n          <td class="borderClass">2</td>\n        </tr>\n                  <tr>\n            <td class="borderClass" align="left">Animation</td>\n            <td class="borderClass">6</td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td class="borderClass" align="left">Sound</td>\n            <td class="borderClass">6</td>\n          </tr>\n                <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass" align="left">Character</td>\n          <td class="borderClass">1</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass" style="border-width: 0;" align="left">Enjoyment</td>\n          <td class="borderClass" style="border-width: 0;">1</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n    </div>\n\n                          \n    Anime Humdrum:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy hero academia came out at a perfect time. The very popular long running series Naruto ended, and superheroes were all the rage in western culture. Everyone was searching for the next series to quench their thirst. That\xe2\x80\x99s when the anime community was introduced to a long running super hero fighting anime, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Hero Academia.\xe2\x80\x9d. The creator, Horikoshi, made the number one hero in the series to look like Captain America &amp; Superman\xe2\x80\x99s love child. And the number one hero has moves referencing American states which the protagonist uses. Clearly the show was shouting out at a western audience &amp; it worked. The show\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review303471">\n        brought in anime fans, superhero fans, American fans, and casual viewers. At one point, even I was liking the show. It was until after a few days of sitting on it that I started to realize this show is not something I can praise. I went back through my experience &amp; noticed all its plot inconsistencies, poor characterization, bad story-telling, boring fights, weak villains, its repetitive structure in every season, and how it offended me on personal level. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory: The world is a hero hierarchy. Eighty percent of the population has magical superpowers. Children are indoctrinated at a young age to become heroes or ultimate police force of their countries, towns, cities, etc. Villains are born in because of unfair rules. Humans are banned from being heroes as its too dangerous up until now. Where our lead, Izuku Midoriya, a poor human comes in. Izuku has a dream of being the number one hero. Can he do it being broke and powerless? Watch to find out...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll point out is poor characterization because I rank that highly for my metric scale. Nearly every character in the series is badly written. Considering this is a show about heroes the main thing you want to do is create relatable characters. Otherwise an audience won\xe2\x80\x99t feel emotional investment to care about their progression. It\xe2\x80\x99s why the western hero Spiderman is one of the most beloved heroes ever. This is because despite his powers he has relatable problems humans go through. All the characters in this show are cardboard cutouts of each other or knockoff versions of better characters from better series. They react the same and don&#039;t stand out unless the author demands it for an episode or two to poorly manipulate audience\xe2\x80\x99s emotions. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nExample\xe2\x80\x99s: <br />\r\n1a: Uraraka, has a sudden arc about how poor her family is to be forgotten about. The conflict isn\xe2\x80\x99t resolved nor discussed again. A better writer might have shown hints beforehand for buildup or show Uraraka working on resolving said issues like getting a job. Otherwise why bring up the conflict if a resolution is not handled well nor worked on? Also there are/were no indications that she was/is poor to begin with which could have been indicated by her clothing, attitude, and body hygiene. Whilst, those may be simple reasons to indicate a character is poor it would have made more sense for the later reveal. Lastly, for some reason she is in love with Deku all because he saved her once when overall the relationship has no depth whatsoever. They share nothing in common nor do they talk feed off each-other organically. Every time I see them interact I cringe because it&#039;s as if the writer is putting in a fantasy over himself getting a &quot;cute&quot; girl to fawn over him. When in reality any girl would be turned off by a whiny basic bitch like Deku. Overall, Uraraka comes off as a empty cheerleader who&#039;s main goal is to suck off Deku when they share no chemistry at all. If anything Uraraka matches much better with the Bakugou as he inspired her to elevate her training, work harder, and take heroism much more seriously.  <br />\r\n1b: Iida, deals with the dilemma of revenge to easily forgetting about it after a chat with a friend. This is never mentioned again and the emotional investment to his family was never built up beforehand. A good author might have shown hints, or have it take-longer for Iida to overcome his moral dilemmas. Iida is that type of character with a stick-up-his-ass. That one that likes to follow the rules obnoxiously close. However, for some reason, like the rest of the bland characters, he gets along with everyone and even lets perverts like Mineta constantly get away with sexually harassing classmates without informing authority figures. So really he doesn&#039;t stay true to his &quot;character&quot; and is forced to &quot;get along&quot; with everyone over this fake safe space the author created. In reality characters like Mineta and Bakugou would be hated for being assholes, harassing other classmates, and making others uncomfortable. Meanwhile, Iida himself would be known as a rat and most likely have few to no friends. <br />\r\n1c: Momo, has an arc showing insecurities &amp; has a panic attack. This behavior was never hinted previously. The &quot;insecurity&quot; is cured after a conversation &amp; is forgotten about. To think these deep seeded issues can be solved after talking for fifteen minutes. Momo in the beginning is an obnoxious cunt. Later, the series tries to bate sympathy by showing she has anxiety &amp; panic attacks but this is given no basis and is never brought up again in the context of the show. Overall, a wooden girl with a disgusting hero outfit for fan service... seriously why would an institution like this allow a teenage girl to wear an outfit that revealing? <br />\r\n1d: Shoto has an arc about family trauma but after a conversation is convinced to change by visiting his abusive mother and to work out issues with similar abusive father. This cheapens the character. Why should an audience be concerned if character\xe2\x80\x99s problems are solved through small talk? A good author would show Shoto slowly developing solutions on his own. Not have the lead play God to solve everyone\xe2\x80\x99s issues. Shoto had potential but this series ruined it by having his development rely on Deku&#039;s words. How pathetic and distasteful by cheapening the real damage of parental abuse.<br />\r\n1e: Bakugou, has an ongoing arc/gag of his wailing inferiority complex. It doesn&#039;t make sense as the one he feels inferior to is a powerless wimpy Izuku Midoriya. I can only assume its because Izuku is the main character but Bakugou doesn&#039;t know this. The motivations he has are to be a hero because he wants to be the best. Wow. Such rich motivation. The bullying he does to others I thought would be do to having abusive parental figures. However, his family life is fairly good. So, the only excuse for him actively picking on the weak must be because he is a sociopath. Next for some reason the author thinks its a great idea to have Bakugou constantly opening up his feelings to the one he&#039;s abusing. When it makes no sense. Why would any bully confess personal insecurities to their victim? It reminds me of a Key &amp; Peele skit titled, &#039;School bully&#039;. The only way I can see why Bakugou is an extreme favorite amongst fans is because his commentary about the show is disturbingly very meta, &quot;extra&#039;s fumigate, nothing makes sense, nobody is worth remembering, &amp; Deku is the worst!&quot; - Yes that sums up the show perfectly Bakugou! So, I&#039;ll let him slide as an ironically likable character. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n1f: Izuku Midoriya/Deku, the worst shonen protagonist I&#039;ve ever encountered. Deku is essentially a boy scout bore who is cringe worthy at best and extremely annoying at worst. In the beginning Deku claims being a hero is the number one goal yet idolizes a bully &amp; never once trains. As once Deku learns he has no powers he gives up. All Deku did for fourteen years, according to information from episode 1, was take notes of pros, cry, &amp; complain. It&#039;s until a deus ex machina happens when the number 1 hero, the leads cherished idol, All Might decides to select Deku to give his superpowers too. It happens after All Might witnesses Deku attempt to save his bully from a monster whom would have easily killed him if it wasn&#039;t for plot armor. Meanwhile, three able pro heroes stood by for no reason. No logic. So, after one event of recklessness &amp; plot stupidity the number one hero picks Deku a random, lazy, crybaby whom he just met to be a successor. All because All Might thinks Deku is a lot like himself. This is do to All Might previously being quirk-less and given said powers. So, All Might did this all for the feels. Quite frankly that logic makes him sound like a complete fucking moron. As later we find out he has huge life threatening battle scars from being reckless &amp; emotional yet he picks the first reckless crybaby bitch he sees???? All Might is the number one hero believing in childish idiotic mindsets. How does that make any sense at all? <br />\r\n<br />\r\n1f: The fact that Deku was selected would make any hardworking person rage. Deku throughout gets unrealistic, undeserved, free, overpowered things for being reckless &amp; stupid. It&#039;s as if you&#039;re watching a brat from sweet sixteen trying to come off as likable &amp; relatable. Maybe I would have liked the show if Deku had remained human to explore the clear bigotry/racism the universe has over humans. However, the creator does not want to take on complex issues and instead ignores them after Deku gets free powers. Why show us human bigotry &amp; ignore humans capabilities when there are characters later introduced like Stain who defeats pro-heroes by primarily not using his quirk. Stain is fast, agile, and a swords master through human conditioning not through his quirk. Yet the story ignores this completely. Perhaps lazy Deku could have trained like Stain to be a hero. However, instead Deku easily gets things through deus ex machina\xe2\x80\x99s, crying, &amp; by events he causes. One might say he gets injured a great deal. However, he is instantly healed after every fight and there are no large ramifications nor consequences to him. So, really he is the least bit underdog. As by season 2 another deus ex machina happens as Deku&#039;s quirk has a will of its own which can break him out of OP mind control quirks. So, whenever Deku is out of commission his quirk will save him. Spoilers: in the manga he has seven more free quirks! Talk about thick ass plot armor! What is inspiring or likable about this whiny character or innovative to the anime medium? All that happens revolves around Deku be it luck, plot armor, or deus ex machina&#039;s for someone underserving, whiny &amp; pathetic!! <br />\r\n<br />\r\n1f: Deku after one year of strength training with All Might learns advanced combat abilities &amp; easily goes toe to toe with bullies &amp; murderous villains. How does strength training equal precise combat knowledge and him losing the previous timid behavior he had? Notes/weight lifting do not equal a black belt in martial arts. One cannot watch a few UFC matches, take notes, and use those moves without practice in heated battles against fearsome bullies or murderous freaks. An example, the toss Deku does to Bakugou in season 1. Deku is 5\xe2\x80\x995, Bakugou is 5\xe2\x80\x997, thats 15 Ibs of difference. Considering Bakugou was wearing 6 Ibs gauntlets its an added 12 Ibs. Plus, Bakugou has trained for years, has more muscle mass, and has far superior experience in martial arts. It&#039;s impossible for someone with no experience nor practice to use moves like this in heated battles and succeed against opponents who are aged experienced fighters. Considering this clear stupidity, pathetic and offensive nature to actual martial arts the writer doubles down by having Deku train for a single week during an internship. When Deku gets back he is able to easily do acrobatic moves like Bakugou. It&#039;s obvious the creator did no research into the significance of martial arts training nor does he have respect for it. Those moves are difficult &amp; take much time. Naruto had realism as far as that goes. All those characters trained for years to preform those moves. In Yu Yu Hakusho characters trained for months &amp; years. Deku trains for a week and is on par with advanced fighters. This is a disgrace! Why should anyone root for this whiny privilege underserving crybaby?!! Deku claims to be an underdog yet he gets everything handed to him: he has deus ex machinas, followers, the number 1 hero as a coach, girls, the number 1 quirk(s), the chosen one, &amp; learns moves faster than any experienced fighters from any anime ever. This all happens less than 50 episodes into the show. Is this an unintentional comedy?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1f: For the exams to enter UA (the number one hero school) Deku apparently gets the highest amount of rescue points for beating 1 off limit zero-point robot to save only 1 person. Why would a national hero school reward students for destroying something they said was worth zero points, and who significantly injure themselves in the process? If that were a real crisis Deku would be on the ground useless while more villains infiltrated. Plus If Uraraka hadn&#039;t used her gravity quirk to bitch slap him he would&#039;ve died! So yet again Deku is awarded for clear stupidity &amp; the plot changing its consistency whenever it wants?! In other words, you can&#039;t take the rules set in the show seriously as the author changes them whenever he feels like it to benefit his prized pony bitch Deku. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n1f: Deku\xe2\x80\x99s fighting animation is shit. Overall the fighting animation is generic, terrible, boring, and uninspired. However, Deku&#039;s is by far the worst. As all Deku does to achieve victory is though a punch or kick with no thought in the animation, camera angles, design, etc. Never once do we get a fight where we have strategic battle understanding, clever tactic, comedic ideas, or unique animation. This is problematic for a multitude of reasons especially considering the series presents Deku as one of the &quot;smartest students&quot;, but he never uses his so-called intelligence. Instead he endangers young children constantly, destroys his body over soft emotional bait, is extremely reckless, &amp; not smart whatsoever. In fact I consider his intellect to be almost average, which is odd considering the setting Japan. Japan has one of the highest education systems worldwide. I guess the setting must be in America for this show. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n1f: Some might say Deku may be a terrible but at least we have others to focus on. Unfortunately that is not the case as whenever other characters get a chance they are forgotten about, played for laughs (Iida), used to down play the significance of abuse (Shoto), or later used for just having a crush on him (Uraraka). The other characters have no goals of their own unless Deku has something to do with it! Everything important to other characters has to revolve around this pathetic lead &amp; its horrible. As Deku is one of the worst characters ever. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Literally, a hero who is emotionally unstable, admires sociopathic bullies, gets things through deus ex machinas, gets undeserved handouts, OPs everyone without earning it. In DBZ characters died to get near his current OP levels! WTF!? No wonder Bakugou is so well liked I absolutely agree with everything he says about the damn show &amp; surrounding cast! At least Bakugou can provide the audience with some needed meta comedic relief over this god damn nonsense of a series!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall, there are no psychological dilemma&#039;s for any of the teens without it coming out of nowhere, used for audience manipulation, or being &quot;cured&quot; after thirty minutes. Otherwise, these characters exist as unfunny gags, exposition pieces, or lazy cheerleaders. Hence I will not address other characters as they are vapid at best. All forced to get along over the safe space the author created. Clearly the author does not realize characters are distinguishable in different attitudes, beliefs, and ideas. It makes no sense to create this fake environment because it means none of these characters are distinguishable. They are all programmed bees surrounding the Deku hive. Finally, any author who uses manipulative sob tactics in characters without presenting hints, or indications, beforehand and does not execute resolutions is a terrible writer.\xc2\xa0<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2a - Inconsistent &amp; Idiotic plot. The exam set up to enter the #1 hero school in Japan are to fight as many robots as possible under a selected time limit. The robots are worth points and after the time runs out top scoring kids will be accepted. This is unbelievably uncreative, useless, &amp; moronic. Why wouldn&#039;t they evaluate applicants mental health, have psy. tests, or interviews. Thats what every police force does. If heroes are protecting the public and have dangerous powers they should be evaluated. They should make sure these applicants are not sociopaths, psychopaths, manipulators, liars, or spies. Also why have an exam that ultimately favors strength quirks when applicants like Shinso have far superior mental quirks?? Do to these pathetic worthless admission requirements UA has unknown spies stealing knowledge and sharing it to villains. The #1 hero school has no psychological tests, no interviews, no background checks, no shown measures to prevent spies or villains from being admitted, and only favors strength quirks. Bullshit! This series is not realistic in the least!!! It is laughable how nonsensical it is!! <br />\r\n<br />\r\n3a - The Villains Are Garbage- In season 2 students are punished for self-defense for saving a pro from a serial killer. Yet they defended themselves season 1 during the USJ villain attack and weren&#039;t punished. Oh wait this time the writer is using emotional manipulation to make us feel sympathy for the leads being punished. Well I don&#039;t because it makes no sense. Imagine the headline, &quot;Three Teenagers used self-defense apprehending a dangerous villain&quot; read it again and imagine police punishing teenagers for self defense. Anyways, the villains in this series are the absolute worst. The villains are unsympathetic, boring, ugly, generic, &amp; moronic. Why should I feel anything for a protagonist if the villains they face are literally worthless? Shigaraki, has his first mission to infiltrate the number one hero high school in broad daylight with dozens of villains. Why is he invading a national hero high school guarded by dozens of pro heroes &amp; staff members who out class him? After he magically gets in...the #1 hero school has no cameras in facilities, security guards, nor emergency buttons?? If the show made a lick of sense some of the apparent adult villains brought along would have killed or at least significantly injured a few students. However, that doesn&#039;t happen. This leads the me to believe that there will be no tension nor significant deaths anytime soon. As constantly characters are saved at the last minute and we see no dire consequences. <br />\r\nSo, because of plot armor, and Shigaraki&#039;s reckless stupidity his first mission fails. Next, Shigaraki decides its a great idea to kidnap the winning student of a national hero festival. This in turn reveals his hide out location &amp; gets his master, All For One, thrown in jail. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy is a grown man obsessed with teenagers &amp; not focusing on gathering experienced adults for his evil organization? Shigaraki is an ugly, unsympathetic, uninteresting, whiny, loser who does nothing to properly advance his goals. I\xe2\x80\x99ve caught up with the manga &amp; his actions get progressively more stupid. For example in the manga he purposely destroys a weapon that works to eliminate quirks. This makes no sense. That weapon would be very useful in defeating pro-heroes which is what his goal is. Also he has one of the worst villain backstories ever. The reason to why he is a psychopathic killer is because his father slapped him a few times &amp; refused to let him become a hero. However, aside from that he grew up in a fancy home with loving family members. Yet one night he kills all of them over getting a slap...yet we are supposed to feel sympathy or a sort of understanding to this piece of scum psycho when he has absolutely NO redeeming qualities. Shigaraki is the same as Deku because both are spoiled rotten who get everything without earning a DAMN THING. As now in the manga for no reason, no previous training, no buildup Shigaraki can destroy an entire town with his power. Fuck this series!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe creator also introduces these braindead Nomu monsters as slaves to the villains. This is an attempt to make the villains look better by comparison. Similar to how robots are thrown in next to our bland heroes. However, in reality it only makes both groups look lackluster as they rely on these things instead of strengths or personalities of their own. Other villains like Stain have no depth, sympathy, charm, charisma, or are even good looking. The only thing going for him is he is strong and proves the racist viewpoint of humans being weak wrong. However, this idea is never discussed in the series so it proves a moot point. Also he thinks heroes are fake if they are not strong. When strength has nothing to do with the definition of heroism. Also If these villains want the absolute destruction of pro-heroes...then why are they concerned with kids in high school? Why not go to the underground villain society, gather experienced *adult* members, or stress about trained pros hunting them? Why is this ignored? It&#039;s ignored because this series makes no fucking sense!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4a- Bad Story Telling- If this is a #1 hero school why aren\xe2\x80\x99t lessons, philosophies, anti heroes, or moralities taught or even discussed? Hell why the fuck aren&#039;t martial arts classes introduced?! Instead, all we see is characters believing &amp; talking in the exact same fashion over and over and over and over again. Robotically and for that matter why have challenges be so focused on fighting robots? All these fights revolve around, &#039;let\xe2\x80\x99s fight because you\xe2\x80\x99re basic&#039;. There is no meaning, build up, nuance, ideas, or understanding. It\xe2\x80\x99s all thrown out of nowhere and resolved just the same. In fact how are most of these students admitted to this #1 hero school? Most of the students are complete morons. It&#039;s claimed the school has a 2 percent acceptance rate numerous times. Yet nearly all the students enrolled have weak powers and dull minds. The series makes it a point to stress about the overwhelming importance of powers. However, the number one hero killer relies on human abilities to kill pro heroes! SO Why does the creator ignore this?!! Why introduce that UA was accepting humans to then have none be admitted?! The creator could have used this information as an opportunity to place a strong human-hero into the story. However, that would take significant attention away from his prized pony bitch Izuku. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n5a: It&#039;s Boring - In season two the majority focuses on a televised sports festival which apparently has more viewership than the modern day olympics. Yet two out of the three main events are fighting fodder robots, and playing chicken. I&#039;m sure I&#039;d love to spend time watching a bunch of freshmen fight lame robots and play chicken. The players are also keyword &quot;freshmen&quot; so naturally they are going to be inexperienced. So, why would anyone want to watch this? Here&#039;s how the writer could have done the event. Take the top four students from each grade out of the top 10 district high schools to fight. The fights are four on four matches till one team is left. That winning team wins grand prize of money, fame, ranking, etc. and makes the school reputation &amp; revenue go up. This would set up attention to seniors, juniors, sophomores, etc. The UA freshmen pick could be Shoto do to his fathers position of power. The UA junior pick could be Mirio. There are stakes for school rep., money, student careers, bets, blackmail, etc. and it would make more sense to tune in. Have one of the fighters be an OP human to give controversy. Show how far schools go to keep reputations. How much status &amp; popularity are apart of a heroes success and why its wrong. Show Bakugou upset he wasn&#039;t picked and know that Shoto got selected through family connection. Maybe this would give Bakugou a reason to turn villainous. Show the class wanting to be in this selection and how it motivates them all. Wow what better elements that could have been added. A novice writer came up with better ideas than the creator of this nonsense bullshit series. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n4b: Bad Story Telling: In season 3 we have a license exam. If students pass they get to be legal heroes. The setup for the exam is ball tag to saving staged crisis actors. WHERE ARE THE MENTAL EVALUATIONS? Christ this is where they are given the freedoms to fight criminals in public and we have no student interviews, questions, psy. tests, etc.? It&#039;s common sense! To top it off nearly every UA kid passes except Bakugou and Todoroki. However, they can pass by taking extra classes. So who cares about them failing they can easily pass in two months. Why did every UA student pass as far as I can see most are very incompetent &amp; dumb. What the writer could have done is have more than half fail the first test. Then those that failed would wait a year to try again. That way we could get some necessary development for those lame characters. Having everyone pass feels extremely illogical given we&#039;ve seen how moronic most are. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n6a: S.3- In season 3 they introduce a few new characters. These other characters introduced are gags. Mirio one of the big three of UA has a gag of getting naked to use his power. Then we find out all the top three students are third years. No seniors? That seems very illogical. Then of course they&#039;re all quirky, goofy, and awkward. This makes them feel very lifeless. If they are the elites at the #1 hero school UA have them be intimidating. Don&#039;t use their characters as gags because thats what they&#039;ll become GAGS! A similar pattern the creator uses on all his empty useless characters.   <br />\r\n<br />\r\n7a: Comparisons: I can&#039;t believe people think MHA deserves a rating over at most a 4. Naruto is better than this and Naruto sucked. Naruto had a consistent training progress, stellar animation, etc. It had a team who researched and understood martial arts. There is none of that in MHA. Everything is sloppily put together. All the attention in MHA is to one of the most insufferable leads in all of anime. Even Gon from HxH who is thought as goodie goodie broke moral convictions, worked hard, didn\xe2\x80\x99t complain, and accomplished his dreams instead of waiting for a deus ex machina (All Might) to come along. Most importantly, Gon didn&#039;t play god to every characters development! Gon is twelve and he is more emotionally mature than Deku ever will be.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n8a: Credit: I will give the series credit for its decent art, sometimes catchy music from Openings, Endings, Soundtrack, etc... The series shows off some creative powers. However, dozens of shows do this exceedingly better. I refuse to waste time on generic cookie cutter short attention span entertainment. MHA brings down opportunities for other creators because audiences continue to give money too bland anime like it. There hasn&#039;t been a Fist of the North Star, DBZ, YYH, or HxH for a reason and it will continue to be this way by how you invest your money &amp; time in anime. Stop investing in shit and give your money to good creators! Watch and support Vinland Saga the most decent fighting series we&#039;ve had in years!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall, this is a show with a majority of bad characters, nonsense world building, boring fighting animation, piss poor villains, no depth, no personality, it&#039;s not challenging in ideas of morality/ethics/society, it takes no risks, and most importantly its insulting on a multitude of levels to martial arts, abuse victims, nerds, and even bullies.  It prevents quality shows from being produced &amp; funded. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory - 1/10<br />\r\nArt - 7/10<br />\r\nSound - 6/10<br />\r\nCharacter - 1/10<br />\r\nEnjoyment - 1/10<br />\r\nOverall- 1.7/10<br />\r\n\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_303471" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-303471">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Fanime%2F36456%2FBoku_no_Hero_Academia_3rd_Season" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle303471"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="303471">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=303471" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=303471" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right; text-align: right;">\n      <div title="10:55 PM">Sep 30, 2018</div>\n      <div class="lightLink spaceit">\n                  25 of 25 episodes seen\n              </div>\n      <div>\n        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$(\'#score290580\').toggle()">Overall Rating</a>:\n        4\n      </div>\n    </div><div style="float: left;">\n      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">\n        <tr>\n                                              <td valign="top" width="60">\n              <div class="picSurround">\n                <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/DiscoMilf">\n                  <img src="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/userimages/4323635.jpg?t=1587350400" data-src="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/userimages/4323635.jpg?t=1587350400" border="0" class=" lazyloaded" width="48">\n                </a>\n              </div>\n            </td>\n                    <td valign="top">\n                          <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/DiscoMilf">DiscoMilf</a>\n              <small>(<a href="/profile/DiscoMilf/reviews">All reviews</a>)</small><br>\n                        <div class="lightLink spaceit">\n              <strong>\n                <span id="rhelp290580">115</span>\n              </strong>\n              people found this review helpful\n            </div>\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class="spaceit textReadability word-break pt8 mt8" style="clear: both; border-top: 1px solid #ebebeb;">\n        <div style="float: left; display: none; margin: 0 10px 10px 0" id="score290580">\n      <table border="0" width="105" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="borderClass" style="border-width: 1px;">\n        <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass bgColor1"><strong>Overall</strong></td>\n          <td class="borderClass bgColor1"><strong>4</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass" align="left">Story</td>\n          <td class="borderClass">3</td>\n        </tr>\n                  <tr>\n            <td class="borderClass" align="left">Animation</td>\n            <td class="borderClass">6</td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td class="borderClass" align="left">Sound</td>\n            <td class="borderClass">5</td>\n          </tr>\n                <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass" align="left">Character</td>\n          <td class="borderClass">3</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass" style="border-width: 0;" align="left">Enjoyment</td>\n          <td class="borderClass" style="border-width: 0;">0</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n    </div>\n\n                          \n    [THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS for Hunter x Hunter, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, Naruto, and Boku no Hero Academia Seasons 1, 2, and 3]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhenever a show gets super popular here on my anime list dot com, a large group of anime viewers watch it and give it a rating. This rating is calculated with all the other user&#039;s ratings and creates an overall ranking system. The system MAL employs emphasizes an overall ranking that naturally lends itself to abuse by people who want their favorite show to be #1. This results in a lot of fluff being upvoted to near the top, and it\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review290580">\n        also gives shallow people a means to push shows they don&#039;t like down the rankings. It emphasizes all the bad things about criticism, leads people to attack each other based on whether or not they gave their favorite show a good enough arbitrary number, and unfortunately can also lead people to have a lot of false expectations based on a misleading number.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhich leads me to Boku no Hero Academia. a show that has drawn comparisons to Hunter x Hunter and taken the anime community by storm, while sporting 3 seasons with very high ratings in the MAL rankings. It is these comparisons to Hunter x Hunter and the bloated MAL ranking that gave me the impression that BNHA was going to push the shounen genre in a bold new direction, much like Hunter x Hunter did.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt doesn&#039;t. Boku no Hero Academia is an average superpower shounen that follows closely (extremely closely) in the steps of Naruto and Hunter x Hunter without really adding anything new to the genre. Normally I would watch something like this, shrug, and move on. But the MAL ranking raised my expectations, which led me to be disappointed. It&#039;s a rather odd predicament as I&#039;m forced to find some middle ground between my expectations based off what I was told, and the reality of what Boku no Hero Academia actually is. It fails to live up to the gold standard Hunter x Hunter set, but should I really be comparing the two? Comparing anything to Hunter x Hunter is rather unfair, but if the community wants to make those comparisons I&#039;ll be happy to tear them down. let&#039;s begin!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n~Art/Animation~<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll start off with the best part of the show: the art and animation. Everything is certainly drawn and animated well, and all the backgrounds appear to be drawn well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat isn\xe2\x80\x99t to say that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have serious gripes with the how the show chooses to present itself visually. You see, in most shows I would call good, a number of non-verbal techniques are used to tell the audience things about what they\xe2\x80\x99re seeing without telling them. Usually the staff find ways to let the audience know that the fight or confrontation they\xe2\x80\x99re witnessing is important, or they convey what feelings the combatants are experiencing via the camera, animation, body language, etc. This can be depicted with audio or visually but for something that\xe2\x80\x99s animated, visual usually works best. Stuff like this is NECESSARY during big fights to sell the significance and scope of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe point of a big climactic fight is to create a duel of clashing ideologies of characters that come to a head in a dynamic battle that is SUPPOSED to be an emotional crescendo where everything is hashed out and everything they\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to say and express comes out. This does not happen in the fight between Deku and Bakugo. It should have. Their rivalry is key to the structure of the series and it is supposed to carry a lot of emotional weight behind it. It\xe2\x80\x99s the BNHA equivalent of Naruto vs Sasuke. Yet watching what is supposed to be the climax to season 3, the dominant emotion I felt during it was boredom. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t successfully convey any of the emotions of their jagged, unstable relationship and the fight itself doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really solve anything. In big fights like Gon vs Neferpitou and Naruto vs Sasuke, the characters actually talk to each other. They yell at each other, respond to the others\xe2\x80\x99 comments, and are driven emotionally and strategically by the actions of their opponents. This does not happen during the Deku-Bakugo fight. Deku spends the entire fight thinking about their relationship, while Bakugo has a few lines that don\xe2\x80\x99t connect emotionally due to how restrained the vocal delivery is. This is the most vulnerable we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen Bakugo and this is really the best direction they could accomplish? His body language doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change. His movements don\xe2\x80\x99t change. Neither do Midoriya\xe2\x80\x99s. This is a problem, as it implies that the emotions of the scene aren\xe2\x80\x99t changing their behavior. This is just another angsty fight for them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo elaborate with an example (spoilers for Return of the Jedi): during Return of the Jedi, there is an excellent fight scene between Luke and Darth Vader. A part of the reason this fight works so well is that Luke\xe2\x80\x99s movements and body language change during the fight. At one point, Vader really gets under his skin by making some comments about Leia. While Luke does indicate this audibly (yelling), its his attacking style that changes the most. Suddenly, he\xe2\x80\x99s hammering Vader with really violent, angry strikes that indicate his emotional state has been changed and he can longer control his anger. It expresses the emotions of the fight in a subtle way that\xe2\x80\x99s engaging to the audience. This is also important because it indicates Vader is succeeding in trying to corrupt Luke by making him give in to his anger.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow think about how a scene that\xe2\x80\x99s also very important in BNHA season 3 handles it. Deku and Bakugo do not change their general fight movements and strategy during this fight at all. They also don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to each other much, making this a very awkward-feeling fight that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t convey much emotion and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t accomplish anything. The animation style doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change either. What Deku and Bakugo are feeling is established entirely through their inner thoughts or outright told to us. This is a big no-no when it comes to a visual medium.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor an example in the realm of anime, Naruto employed non-verbal storytelling extremely well during the fight between Rock Lee and Gaara. After Lee removes his weights, the animators employ a lot of speed blurs and very quick animation to indicate Lee\xe2\x80\x99s blinding speed. Rather than throwing Lee into a speed-line tunnel like most shows would, you see Lee\xe2\x80\x99s extremely blurred outline zip across the screen. They do tell us Lee\xe2\x80\x99s fast, but they support this by having him zip around while Gaara is moving like normal. This does an excellent job of establishing how ridiculously fast Lee is flying around by showing his speed relative to Gaara\xe2\x80\x99s normal movements. Having the camera pan around Gaara also helps sell this by conveying to the audience the same disorienting, overwhelmed feeling that Gaara is experiencing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is another thing the fight between Deku and Bakugo, and all the fights in BNHA, lack. The animators neglected to take advantage of the visual medium they were using to add a creative spin on the storytelling in fights. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same restrained animation during the fights and outside of them, which leaves the fights feeling flavorless and dull. There\xe2\x80\x99s no visual pop at all. No fun angles, no experimental animation styles, no interesting framing. Nothing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are ways to tell the audience things without using words, and BNHA has consistently displayed no capacity to employ aspects of non-verbal storytelling. It would rather tell you what characters are thinking and feeling rather than showing them. This is a sin in storytelling, and one of the first big no-no\xe2\x80\x99s you\xe2\x80\x99ll learn in any film school or lesson in storytelling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithout a creative way to express its story and emotions visually, it would be difficult for me to say the animation department did a job here. Everything moves as it should, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the absolute minimum compliment you can give something that\xe2\x80\x99s animated . Animation/art 6/10<br />\r\n<br />\r\n~Music~<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe score in this show is extremely bland. I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of a single track that sticks out, and its placement is equally bland. Music 5/10<br />\r\n<br />\r\n~Story~<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI have a mountain of criticisms regarding the story. (Here\xe2\x80\x99s the key points if you wanna TLDR: villains are basically team rocket in that they always lose, no one ever dies so the plot never establishes a truly dangerous or threatening tone, the story is full of extremely safe and recycled storylines, and there are far too many characters focused on which bloat the run time and slows pacing to a crawl.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor starters, one flaw that kept popping up in this season was how they attempted to keep developing ALL of Deku&#039;s classmates. This results in a plot that moves slow as molasses. The &quot;testing/graduation&quot; phase of Hunter x Hunter focused on 4 individuals mostly, allowing it to truck through the entire testing process within just 11 episodes. BNHA has trudged through this same process for going on for 3 seasons now. There is no need to keep track of how minor characters are training to develop their powers. It&#039;s excessive. Deku, Bakugou, Iida, Todoroki, Uraraka, Tsuyu, and maybe Tokoyami are the ONLY student characters who should be focused on at this point. That&#039;s it. AND THEY&#039;RE TRYING TO KEEP US UP TO DATE ON 20. You can keep SOME of the minor characters involved, but not every last one of them! That bogs down the pace and makes small arcs take an eternity!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou do not need to let the audience know every single thing that&#039;s happening to every character. It&#039;s excessive and takes too much time. Some things just aren&#039;t going to be relevant to the story down the road. Do I really need to be shown exactly how the tape guy is getting stronger? Is it going to become important? I doubt it. A single line of dialogue later would serve the same purpose. It&#039;s unnecessary, it bloats the run time, and in most cases takes up screen time that could be used to help the audience get to know the main characters better. This issue comes up constantly, starting with the opening recap that takes forever to re-establish the quirks of the heroes because there are WAY too many of them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecond, people die a lot in Hunter x Hunter. And they die in Naruto, too! It&#039;s a good way to keep the viewer on their toes and to keep the universe the creators established feeling dangerous and threatening. Whenever I see an expendable character like Pixie Bob not die in a situation she probably should have died in, it annoys me because it reinforces the notion that none of the characters in BNHA can or will die. As such, I find it hard to feel invested when there&#039;s no threat of actual significant harm to any of the main characters. They all have blatant plot armor. Other examples included Best Jeanist surviving in episode 9 in what would have been a great opportunity to establish the overwhelming power of All for One by having him wipe out the number 4 hero; and All Might surviving the fight with All for One when again\xe2\x80\xa6having AFO killing him would have been a great way to establish how powerful and threatening he is. Instead, All for One loses to a total asspull in which they wave off All Might\xe2\x80\x99s crippling injury because \xe2\x80\x9cpeople give me strength\xe2\x80\x9d bullshit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpeaking of villains, they certainly fail to leave an impact. They tend to go on long tirades to make up for their lack of interesting backstories or motives, but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t their biggest problem. The biggest flaw here is that they never, ever win. How great would it have been for All Might to have died to establish All for One as an overwhelming villain? Killing the number one hero would&#039;ve done it. Hell, killing Gran Torino or Best Jeanist would have done it. Just SOMEONE. That way I can believe at some point the villains in this show might actually succeed long-term. Turning Bakugo into a villain which might destabilize the wills of the heroes? They failed. Neutralizing anyone on the kill list during the forest raid? They failed. Accomplish anything during the raid in season one? They failed. Killing All Might when that is all All for One wished to do? He failed. The villains in this series are no better at their job than Team fucking Rocket. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to them, they always lose, and they aren\xe2\x80\x99t even entertaining. They exist purely to give the protagonists something to fight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s also a lack of long-term consequences in this universe. What I mean by that is that any time a potential idea that could shake up the narrative is introduced, it\xe2\x80\x99s immediately waved off at the convenience of the plot. For example: how lame is it to have his mom take a hard stance against UA&#039;s irresponsible bullshit only for All Might to go on some heroic spiel and neutralize her concerns. This would have really made things interesting, as not being allowed to go to UA would have: 1, surprised me for the first time in the entire series and 2, would have been a grounding moment in Deku\xe2\x80\x99s development. He\xe2\x80\x99s basically completely disregarded his mother\xe2\x80\x99s feelings and anyone else\xe2\x80\x99s who might have cared about him by being reckless and throwing himself into danger with no disregard to his own safety. But it\xe2\x80\x99s immediately forgotten after All Might basically begs. Lazy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother good example of this is when Eraser said he thought about expelling the students but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Mainly because they should be expelled. This is where the concept of BNHA taking place in a school kind of hurts it. Once a student is expelled, obviously they&#039;re done there for good. But in, say, Hunter x Hunter, the Hunter exam is just that: a test. Anyone can take it however many times they want. That means that if characters take some drastic action that disqualifies them, all they would have to do is just re-apply the next year. The writers took advantage of this by doing exactly that to Killua, in the process establishing his homicidal nature and unbalanced emotional state. Point being, Hunter x Hunter set itself up for success by thinking 2 steps ahead. Also, they were willing to take chances like separating Killua from Gon in a year to establish an important character trait. That&#039;s excellent writing. BNHA&#039;s half-assed one foot in-one foot out approach to grounding its characters looks shoddy by comparison. If you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna expel them, do it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend like you were going to and then wave it off because it\xe2\x80\x99s convenient. And don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend like the outcome of the exams matter if you\xe2\x80\x99re just going to let anyone who failed take a couple classes so they pass anyways. It\xe2\x80\x99s lazy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat about sums it up. Story 3/10<br />\r\n<br />\r\n~Characters~<br />\r\n <br />\r\nI previously mentioned my issues with focusing on too many characters. But even the ones that are supposed to be focused on really haven\xe2\x80\x99t developed much at all. The best example of this I can think of is Deku and Uraraka.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe &quot;romance&quot; between Uraraka and Deku is one of the most pathetic and undercooked romances I&#039;ve seen across all of film and TV. It&#039;s already hard enough to care considering how their relationship stays parked firmly in neutral and has been for 3 seasons now, but was it really impossible to give Uraraka a personality? She is easily the least fleshed out character of the main bunch and this half-assed romance crap is thrown in our face in almost every arc. They have done absolutely nothing to advance the relationship, so why does it keep coming back for no reason? At this point bringing it up again and again only reinforces the growing notion that Uraraka\xe2\x80\x99s only personality trait is liking Deku. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for the villains, I already mentioned their problem: they never win and they have no interesting backstories or motives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharacters 3/10<br />\r\n<br />\r\n~Enjoyment~<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t really grade for enjoyment. How much you enjoy something is determined by the product of your experiences in life and what you consider to be a quality production, which are different for every single person. As such, attempting to grade something inherently subjective with an objective grading metric is a paradox.  I will leave this score blank.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n~Conclusion~<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll put it bluntly: The key weakness BNHA suffers from is that it has no balls. It takes no chances, has no creativity, makes no sacrifices, and displays no ability to do anything new with the shounen genre in its 3 seasons of existence. But this may not necessarily be entirely its fault. After all, the reason I came into BNHA expecting something great was because it was burdened with unfair comparisons that were unlikely to be met.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe reason I initially thought it was bad was because I was comparing it to Hunter x Hunter, and the reason I did that was because the high MAL ranking and constant comparisons to it in reviews raised my expectations beyond what was realistic to expect. Divorcing BNHA from those lofty comparisons and what I&#039;m left is a totally average and acceptable shounen that has passable animation, average music, mediocre characters, and a bland story that lifts heavily from Naruto and Hunter x Hunter without adding anything of its own to what it borrows.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoku No Hero Academia Season 3 gets a 4/10.<br />\r\n\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_290580" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-290580">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Fanime%2F36456%2FBoku_no_Hero_Academia_3rd_Season" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle290580"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="290580">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=290580" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=290580" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n              \n<div class="borderDark" style="padding: 4px 0;">\n  <div class="spaceit">\n    <div class="mb8" style="float: right; text-align: right;">\n      <div title="3:18 AM">Sep 29, 2018</div>\n      <div class="lightLink spaceit">\n                  25 of 25 episodes seen\n              </div>\n      <div>\n        <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="$(\'#score290341\').toggle()">Overall Rating</a>:\n        7\n      </div>\n    </div><div style="float: left;">\n      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">\n        <tr>\n                                              <td valign="top" width="60">\n              <div class="picSurround">\n                <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lindle">\n                  <img src="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/userimages/232951.jpg?t=1587325200" data-src="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/userimages/232951.jpg?t=1587325200" border="0" class=" lazyloaded" width="48">\n                </a>\n              </div>\n            </td>\n                    <td valign="top">\n                          <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/Lindle">Lindle</a>\n              <small>(<a href="/profile/Lindle/reviews">All reviews</a>)</small><br>\n                        <div class="lightLink spaceit">\n              <strong>\n                <span id="rhelp290341">92</span>\n              </strong>\n              people found this review helpful\n            </div>\n                      </td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class="spaceit textReadability word-break pt8 mt8" style="clear: both; border-top: 1px solid #ebebeb;">\n        <div style="float: left; display: none; margin: 0 10px 10px 0" id="score290341">\n      <table border="0" width="105" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="borderClass" style="border-width: 1px;">\n        <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass bgColor1"><strong>Overall</strong></td>\n          <td class="borderClass bgColor1"><strong>7</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass" align="left">Story</td>\n          <td class="borderClass">7</td>\n        </tr>\n                  <tr>\n            <td class="borderClass" align="left">Animation</td>\n            <td class="borderClass">9</td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td class="borderClass" align="left">Sound</td>\n            <td class="borderClass">7</td>\n          </tr>\n                <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass" align="left">Character</td>\n          <td class="borderClass">9</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td class="borderClass" style="border-width: 0;" align="left">Enjoyment</td>\n          <td class="borderClass" style="border-width: 0;">9</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n    </div>\n\n                          \n    Before this, I would recommend reading my reviews of the first two seasons of Boku no Hero Academia. Many details that explain my opinion on this series in a broader sense are already covered there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis season picks up where the previous season left off, with the students preparing to go to an inevitably doomed summer training camp. The plot takes a much darker tone this season, with The League of Villains newly-emboldened by Stain&#039;s actions in season 2, and full of fresh faces. The first arc of this season gives the new villains a chance to show off what they&#039;re made of, and set up\n\n          <span style="display: none;" id="review290341">\n        the league as a more immediate, tangible threat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithout spoiling too much, the following arc goes even further into developing The League of Villains, finally introducing their leader and revealing his true plan. It also sets up for a changing of the guard for both the heroes and the villains, building towards Deku and Shigaraki becoming arch-enemies in the vein of their mentors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile these two arcs excel due to their establishing a greater cast of villains and creating a sense of genuine threat, the following arc doesn&#039;t fare quite as well. The Provisional License Exam arc doesn&#039;t serve much purpose in the overarching plot other than to get the story from point A to point B. While there is some exploration of Todoroki&#039;s grudge against his father, this isn&#039;t anything we haven&#039;t already covered elsewhere. Ultimately, without it being as firmly rooted in the emotional journey of its characters, it has a lot less substance than the other arcs, and feels awkward and transitionary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is exacerbated by some uncharacteristically bad pacing for this series, with two filler episodes sandwiched into it along with some added scenes and dialogue, presumably included to make sure that the season ended at a good point rather than smack in the middle of another arc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile one of the two filler episodes (technically three, but the first was a start-of-season recap) follows a similar idea to season 2&#039;s surprisingly good filler episode, in covering events that happened offscreen to secondary 1-A characters, the other is a completely unnecessary waste of time that accomplishes little more than plugging the movie. And even the better of the two fails to repeat the same success of season 2&#039;s filler, partially because while the previous one came as a breather episode inbetween story arcs, this one directly interrupted the plot in progress. It also doesn&#039;t help that Tsuyu is a better character than Yaoyorozu (fight me, nerds).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe writing is also noticeably worse during filler, in particular for Uraraka and Bakugo. Uraraka gets a lot of screentime in additional scenes, but almost all of her dialogue in these scenes revolves around her uncertainty around her feelings for Deku, something we had already established and which didn&#039;t need repeating ad nauseam. Bakugo on the other hand plays up all his worst character traits in the movie-plugging filler episode, but where his recklessness in canon is usually due to his anger and frustration with Deku, here it&#039;s pure idiocy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce the exam is over, however, the quality immediately picks back up. And whatever disservice the filler may have done for Bakugo, it&#039;s easily forgotten after he gets some long overdue character development. While Bakugo was never a bad character, he wasn&#039;t a likeable one either. But Bakugo&#039;s character arc has been long in process - with his entire worldview being flipped on its head the moment Deku gained a quirk, Bakugo has been challenged with the thought that he&#039;s no longer superior to everyone around him - a belief that he had always taken for granted until then. This season finally takes this setup and brings it to a conclusion redeeming an oft-maligned character in the process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall, while the quality of this season does take a noticeable dip during the provisional license exam, even then it isn&#039;t bad - just underwhelming in comparison. Outside of this arc, it matches (and in places exceeds) the benchmark the previous season set.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd for any mistakes the series may make, it still manages to retain investment in both the ever-evolving setting and its quirky (pun not intended) ensemble cast, the latter in particular benefiting not only from more character arcs, drama, and development, but from increased downtime letting us see more of these characters outside of their roles in the plot, fleshing out more of their personalities and character dynamics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the series ending on a foreboding note, Hero Academia promises great things to come - but for now, Hero Academia 3 is an impressive, if uneven, entry in the series.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory/Plot: 7/10<br />\r\nCharacters: 9/10<br />\r\nAnimation/Art: 9/10<br />\r\nSound: 7/10<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall: 7/10<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor Fans Of: One Piece, Naruto\n        \n<div id="revhelp_output_290341" class="mt8 js-review-btn-helpful js-review-helpful-290341">\n      <a href="https://myanimelist.net/login.php?from=%2Fanime%2F36456%2FBoku_no_Hero_Academia_3rd_Season" class="button_form">Helpful</a>\n  </div>\n      </span>\n      <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="reviewToggle290341"\n         class="js-toggle-review-button" data-id="290341">read more</a>\n      </div>\n  <div>\n    <div class="mt12 pt4 pb4 pl0 pr0 clearfix">\n      <div style="float: right;">\n                  <a href="https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=290341" class="lightLink"><small>permalink</small></a> |\n                        <a href="https://myanimelist.net/dbchanges.php?go=reportreview&amp;id=290341" class="lightLink">\n          <small>report</small>\n        </a>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class="mt4"></div><div class="amazon-ads anime-manga-detail bottom pt20 pb16">\n<script type="text/javascript">\namzn_assoc_placement = "adunit0";\namzn_assoc_search_bar = "false";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = "animedetail-20";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = "search";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = "smart";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = "amazon";\namzn_assoc_region = "US";\namzn_assoc_title = "Buy on Amazon.com ";\namzn_assoc_default_search_phrase = "My Hero Academia 3";\namzn_assoc_default_category = "DVD";\namzn_assoc_linkid = "d33d41183eb8aee6216ffe9ff44ca735";\namzn_assoc_rows = "1";\namzn_assoc_search_bar_position = "bottom";\n</script>\n<script src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US"></script>\n</div>            <div class="mal-ad-unit" data-ad-width="801" data-ad-height="633">\n        <div id="taboola-below-article-thumbnails-anime"></div> <script type="text/javascript">\n  window._taboola = window._taboola || [];\n  _taboola.push({\n    mode: \'alternating-thumbnails-a\',\n    container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails-anime\',\n    placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails Anime\',\n    target_type: \'mix\'\n  });\n</script>\n\n      </div>\n    <br><h2><div class="floatRightHeader"><a href="/anime/36456/Boku_no_Hero_Academia_3rd_Season/news">More news</a></div>Recent News</h2><div class="clearfix"><div class="picSurround fl-l mr8 ml3 mt4"><a href="/news/58303175" class="image-link"><img src="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/spacer.gif" data-src="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/r/50x78/s/common/uploaded_files/1567435577-19e2d703d07ed4ec26689cf03069446c.jpeg?s=6e3353fdb5727ea7c62a087efa676d55" data-srcset="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/r/50x78/s/common/uploaded_files/1567435577-19e2d703d07ed4ec26689cf03069446c.jpeg?s=6e3353fdb5727ea7c62a087efa676d55 1x,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/r/100x156/s/common/uploaded_files/1567435577-19e2d703d07ed4ec26689cf03069446c.jpeg?s=2c5055afffddd871c1a686f6d3c22218 2x" alt="North American Anime &amp;
